# Introduction to Automotive Lighting Systems: External and Internal

## Historical Evolution of Automotive Lighting
Over the years, the evolution of automotive lighting has mirrored not only technological advancements but also the shifting landscape of consumer demands, design aesthetics, and regulatory mandates, culminating in a rich historical trajectory. Examining this path unveils how innovation, functionality, and safety considerations have collectively influenced the development of the vehicles navigating our modern roads.

### From Carbide Lamps to LED Lights

#### Carbide Lamps
Automotive lighting originated with the utilization of acetylene or carbide lamps. Formed by the reaction of calcium carbide with water, these lamps generated light by igniting acetylene gas. Due to susceptibility to wind disturbances and inconsistent light intensity, acetylene or carbide lamps were burdensome, necessitating frequent maintenance despite their effectiveness.
